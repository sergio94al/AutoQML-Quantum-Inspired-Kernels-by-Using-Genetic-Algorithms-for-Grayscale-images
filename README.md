# AutoQML-Quantum-Inspired-Kernels-by-Using-Genetic-Algorithms-for-Grayscale-images

This is the official repository of the article "AutoQML: Automatic Generation and Training of Robust Quantum-Inspired Classifiers by Using Evolutionary Algorithms on Grayscale Images". This article discusses the classification of grayscale images using quantum circuits. Given that images represent high-dimensional data and quantum circuits face challenges in handling them, a strategy is implemented in which dimensionality reduction methods are added.
